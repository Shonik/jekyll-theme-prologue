<p>The Fireman is a VR mini-game in which you play as a Fireman equipped with a JetPack and 2 fire hoses. You have to fly through the city and spray water on the fire points in the allocated time.</br>
I designed and developped this game with Unity. It was originaly made only for PC VR, then I ported it to PSVR and finally we published it on the PS Store.</p>
